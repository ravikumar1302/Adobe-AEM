General Information:

0. AEM : Adobe Experience Manager
1. Content type allowed in AEM : Text, JSON, Images, PDF, PPT
2. AEM has folder like structure. 
    e.g. Site > Languages > products > details Exception

3. CRXDE : Content Repository eXtreme Development Environment. 
    - CRXDE is a JCR (Java Content Repository) interface. 
    - AEM uses Apache Jackrabbit Oak, a hierarchical, node-based NoSQL content repository.
    a) It's a web/ desktop based tool used for directly interacting with the JCR (Java Content Repository) that underpins AEM.
    b) Two main versions: Lite (built-in, web-based) and Full IDE (Eclipse-based desktop IDE, now largely deprecated)

        CRXDE Lite is accessible in a browser via: 
            http://localhost:4502/crx/de  (Replace localhost:4502 with your AEM instance host and port)

            It allows developers to:
                - Browse and edit the JCR repository structure (/apps, /content, etc.).
                - Create, delete, or modify nodes and properties.
                - Upload/download files like .jsp, .xml, .html, .json, etc.
                - Manage permissions on content nodes.
                - View and edit component definitions and configurations.
                - Debug issues in the repository directly (carefully).
