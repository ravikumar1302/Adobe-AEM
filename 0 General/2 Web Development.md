# What is Web Development?

1. Web development is the process of creating and maintaining websites or web apps using code. Like building with bricks, but with programming languages, tools, and frameworks. It covers everything from simple static pages to complex, interactive platforms.

2. The Two Main Parts of Web Development

    - Front-End Development (Client-Side)
    - Back-End Development (Server-Side)

## 3. Front-End Development: The "Face" of the Website

-   Front-end development focuses on the parts of a website users interact with—buttons, images, text, videos, and overall design. It ensures the site looks good and works smoothly.
-   Languages like HTML, CSS and JavaScript are used to create the layout, design, and interactive features of a website.
-   Analogy: Bones/Skelton (HTML) -> Skin/Cloths (CSS) -> Nose breaths (JS)
-   **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)**:

    ```
    - It defines the basic structure of any webpage
    - It tells the browser what to display (like headings, paragraphs, and images) using h1, p, img tag
    - It tells the browser how to structure content, but not how it looks. HTML focuses on content and layout, not styling
    ```

-   **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)**:

    ```
    - CSS makes your webpage look good by styling HTML elements—controlling color, fonts, and layout
    - It uses selectors (p, .class, #id) to apply properties like color, font-size, and margin
    - It follows the cascading rule, where specific styles override general ones. CSS handles layout using tools like flexbox, grid, and positioning
    ```

-   **JavaScript**:

    ```
    - JavaScript adds interactivity to a webpage. It lets you create dynamic content like pop-up messages, interactive forms, image sliders, and even games. Without JavaScript, websites would be static and uninteresting.
    - It runs in browser, lets you manipulate HTML/CSS and responds to user actions (clicks, keys, etc.)
    - JS listens for events ( like clicks, mouse movements or keyboard input ) and runs code to update content (e.g., showing a popup when a button is clicked), make calculations, or fetch data without reloading the page.
    ```

## 4. Back-End Development: The Engine Under the Hood

-   Back-end development is like the engine of a car. Back-end development powers the website behind the scenes—handling data, servers, and logic. Users don’t see it, but it keeps everything running.
-   Back-end developers ensure data is stored securely, requests are processed efficiently, and the right info is delivered (like fetching a product on an e-commerce site).
-   For example, when you log in to a website, the back-end code checks your credentials and lets you in if everything matches.

    ```
    - Server : A server is where your website lives. It’s a powerful computer that stores all the files, data, and information necessary for your website to function.

    - Databases : Websites often need to store data like user profiles, blog posts, or product inventories. Databases like MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL keep all this information organized and accessible.

    - Programming Languages: Back-end developers uses languages like Python, Java, PHP, Ruby and Node.js to create the logic that powers the website and to handle server-side logic, manage databases, process requests and ensure data is delivered securely and efficiently to the front end.
    ```
