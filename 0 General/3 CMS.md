# Understanding CMS

1.  A CMS (Content Management System) helps companies easily create, edit, manage, and publish content (like websites, blogs, or landing pages) without needing to code every time.

2.  Other Website making tools
    a) Dukaan.com
    b) shopify.com
    c) Wordpress.com
    d) Wix
    e) Payload CMS :
    f) Adobe AEM - Paid software for enterprises only. No free version available

3.  Wordpress :

    -   Wordpress for coding less website and Hostinger for hosting it. (other hosting platform is bluehost)
    -   Kitappa.com for already made kits (but it's paid)
    -   flaticon.com for vector and animated icons
    -   logomakr.com for logo
    -   site.com/wp-admin to log in to your website
    -   kadence & Astra (prefer kadence) : go to these website for theme and templatet download in free (or install theme in wordpress, then while activating select template), they are already well coded for responsivenes, speed etc and are very popular and have many templates
    -   themeforest.net for paid themes

    ```
    a) It is used to make website without any coding, or very less coding for certain extra features
    b) Making website is free, but getting domain name and hosting is paid service
    c) Two ways to use : - Local Host : Using XAMPP software or localwp.com, making it on PC, hosting it local on PC like Github, then when you have money, host it on internet. - https://wpcoursetools.com/ : visit this website once for local hosting, here localwp.com is mentioned and also we can check availibility of domain name in free - But as this local hosting-XAMPP is not real hosting, we have to intall this 3rd party application to simulate, it sometime not work properly - On the other hand, localwp installs a bigger 500MB software, but the UI & performance is better than XAMPP - I will recommend localwp.com software, bcz it was looking much cooler and easy than XAMPP

        - Web Host : Using any hosting website, after buying hosting and domain, the website shows option of Wordpress, install and make a website

    d) Use themes and plugins
    e) Use Elementor-plugin to make a website using Drag-Drop
    f) Using elementor, you can make from scratch or by modifying any existing theme
    g) yoast SEO plugin : for SEO related analyisis and help
    h) Site kit by google plugin : for google analyisis, ad sense,
    i) Woo commerce plugin (by wordpress official) : for e-commerce websites, it has in built templates and features needeed for e-commerce websites
    j) wordfence security-firewall and malware scan plugin : for security checks
    k) UpdraftPlus wordpress backup plugin : for backup of website in case of site crash, it automatically backups database and file based on setting you selected
    l) All in one WP Migration : used when website is created on local PC without hosting, so that the website can be hosted. Use this same plugin to export from PC or Import from PC
    ```
