# Web Hosting

1. Web hosting is what makes your website visible on the internet.

    - It stores your website’s files on special computers called servers and delivers them to visitors when they type in your domain name.
    - Web hosting allows websites to be online 24/7 by storing files (images, text, code) on servers.
    - When someone enters your domain (like⁣ - ⁣www.geeksforgeeks.org), the server sends the website files to their browser.

    2. Choose a Hosting Provider : Pick a hosting service based on your site's storage, bandwidth, and support needs.

    3. Server Configuration : Hosting provider allocates server space (shared, VPS, dedicated, or cloud).

    4. Uploading Website Files : Upload HTML, CSS, JS, and media files using FTP or a control panel.

    5. Database Setup : Create a database (e.g., MySQL) for storing dynamic content.

    6. DNS Configuration : Configure DNS to link your domain name to your hosting server.

    7. Website Accessibility : Once DNS propagates, your site becomes accessible globally.

    8. Ongoing Maintenance : Update content, software, and security regularly; perform backups.

    9. Handle Traffic : Monitor and scale hosting resources based on visitor volume.

    10. Technical Support & Troubleshooting : Resolve site issues like downtime or slow performance promptly.
