# Web Hosting

1. Web hosting is what makes your website visible on the internet.

    - It stores your website’s files on special computers called servers and delivers them to visitors when they type in your domain name.
    - Web hosting allows websites to be online 24/7 by storing files (images, text, code) on servers.
    - When someone enters your domain (like⁣ - ⁣www.geeksforgeeks.org), the server sends the website files to their browser.
