BASIC Points : 

1. HTML is not case-sensitive language. So, body == BODY == BoDy. But it is recommended to use LOWER-CASE
1.1. X-HTML is Case sensetive
2. The index.html page is the most common name used for the default page shown on a website if no other page is specified when a visitor requests the site. In other words, index. html is the name used for the homepage of the website
3. Attribute value can be written in single as well as double quotes, i.e., <html lang = "en"> == <html lang = 'en'>, but as string is mostly written in double quotes, better to write in double quotes
4. While changing size of image, it is advisable to change only height or width, it will automatically adjust other value. But changing both will affect the aspect ratio, and image looks bad
5. Use right tag at right places, means use heating tag for heading, not simple text tag and than font size increase, because it affects the page ranking
6. Nested comments : use <!~~ abc ~~> inside <!-- --> to make a nested comment.
7. It is good to have only 1 H1 heading in a webpage.
8. Try having every content of page in some element. You may use <p> for each content. Try avoiding text without having some tag.
