BASIC CSS THEORY :
CSS was first proposed by HÃ¥kon Wium Lie on 10 October 1994. At the time, Lie was working with Tim Berners-Lee at CERN.

Main Topics : Type of CSS, Selectors, CSS Color, CSS Background, CSS Text & Font, Psuedo Class, CSS Border, CSS Box model

0. file Extension : file_name.css
0.1 Use "attribute-extra", here extra can be top, bottom, etc. Means if you want to specificly use one thing, just mention it with the attribute
1. Breaking Acronym : 
    Cascading : Falling of Styles
    Style : Adding designs/ Styling our HTML tags
    Sheets : Writing our style in different documents

2. Basic Structure :
    Selector                        // The selector + Declaration Block is known as CSS Rule
    {                               // The block inside the curly braces is known as Delaration Block
        Property 1 : value;         // Each such line is known as Declaration/ Style
        Property 2 : value;
        Property 3 : value;
    }
    a) Selector : Selects the element you want to target
    b) few basic selector like tags, id's, and classes

3. Three Type : Inline CSS, Internal CSS and External CSS 
    a) Priority Order : Inline > Internal > External
    b) In INLINE style attribute is used, in Internal <Style> tag is used. Add all CSS at one place in HTML file
    c) Demo Code of INTERNAL : Written inside <head> tag
        <html>
        <head>
            <style>
                <!-- Now choose selector like h1, p etc and give values -->
                h1{
                    color : green;
                    background-color : black;
                    text-align : center;
                }
                #id_1_key {    <! -- # is used for id -->

                }
            </style>
        </head>
        </html>
    d) Use <link> tag in html to link EXTERNAL CSS file
        <link rel = "stylesheet" type = "text/css" href = "file_name.css">

5. Five Simple Selectors : 
    Element/ Type Selector : Directly HTML tag name is used. For <h1> we used h1
    Id Selector (#) : Using 'id' attribute in HTML Document and '#' in CSS ('#id_name' in CSS). Id can have any kind of value, character, digit etc.
    Class Selector (.) : Using 'class' attribute in HTML Document and '.' in CSS ('.class_name' in CSS). Differnt type of tags can be given same class, to have same styling
    Group Selector (,) : Just Write tags with comma, h1, h2, p {color : blue;}
    Universal Selector (*) : It appy changes everywhere, *{background-color : black;} 
    
    Priority : Id > Class > Element

6. CSS Color : 
    a) RGB : takes 3 parameter, eg. for red rgb(255, 0, 0), each value vary from 0 to 255
    b) HEX : Start with '#' and has 6 digits, like #ff0000 for red, each set (pair of 2 digit, one set each for rgb), varies from 00 to ff
    c) HSL : Hue Saturation Light eg. (0, 100%, 50%) for red
    d) Website link to easyily findout color codes : https://htmlcolorcodes.com/

7. CSS Background : 
    a) background-image : This property is used to set an image as a background of an element. By default the image covers the entire element.
    b) background-repeat : by default, this property repeated the background image horizontally and vertically. Some images are repated only horizontally or vertically.
    c) background-position : this property is used to define initial position of the background image. By default, the background image is placed on the "top-left" of the web-page.
    E.g.,   <style>
                body {
                    background : url(images/download.jpg);
                    background-repeat : no-repeat;      // use repeat-x for horizontal repeat and repeat-y for vertical
                    background-attachment : fixed;      // Makes the image fixed, even if page is scrolled 
                    background-position : center;       // To center the image on webpage
                    background-size : cover;            // To fill the web page with that image
                }
            </style>

8.  CSS Text and Font : 
    TEXT:
    a) text-color : This property is used to set the color of the text
    b) text-align : This property is used to set the horizontal alignment of a text. A text can be "right or  left aligned, center or justified".
    c) text-decoration : This property is used to set or remove decorations from text. The value "text-decoration : none;" is often used to remove underlines from links.
    d) text-trasform : This property is used to specify uppercase and lowercase letters, capitalise(first letter of each word capital) in a text.

    FONT: It is used to control look of texts. 
    a) font-color : it is used to change the color of the text (standalone attribute)
    b) font-family : used to change the face of the font (like arial, times new roman etc.)
    c) font-size
    d) font-style : the font-style property is mostly used to specify italic text. It has 3 properties : normal, italic and oblique.
    e) font-variant : specifies how to set font varient. It may be small-caps, normal
    f) font-weight : used to increase or decrease the boldness and lightness. It defines the weight of the font and specify how bold a font is. Values are : normal, bold, bolder, lighter or number(100, 200...upto 900)

9. Pseudo Classes :
    a) It can be defined as a keyword which is combined to a selector that defines the special state of the selected elements. It is added to the selector for adding an effect to the existing element based on thier states.
    b) syntax : A pseudo-class starts with colon(:)
        selector : pseudo-class {
            property : value;
        }
    c) pseudi-class is generally of 4 types : link, visited, hover, active. It is mostly used to show state of links and nav-bar by showing differnet color for different state
        : active - used to add style to an active element
        : hover - adds special effects to an element when user moves the mouse pointer over the element
        : link - adds style to a un-visited link
        : visited - adds style to a visited link
        : first-child - adds special effects to an element, which is the first child of another element
    d) Eg.
        <style>
            h1 : hover{
                color : red;
            }
        </style>

10. CSS Border : Sets up border for HTML elements. It has 4 properties :
    a) width 
       style - sets stlye of border like, solid, dashed, dotted, ridge, groove, inset, outset etc.
       color
       radius - determines the roundness of theborder
    
    b) You can set the border for specifically top, right, bottom and left
    c) We can also club top and bottom together and same goes for left and right. 
        e.g.  border-width : 2px 5px; sets top and bottom 2px and left and right 5px
    d) border can also be set in a single lines
        e.g.  border : 2px solid blue;
    e) top right bottom left is the order followed if you give 4 values

11. CSS Box Model : Deals with three things : Border, Padding, MArgin
    a) It consists of 4 edges :   
        Content edge : It comprises of the actual content, like the thin area near each alphabet, e.g. 'H'
        Padding edge : It lies in between content and border edge
        Margin edge : It is outside border and controls margin of the element
        Border edge : Padding is followed by the border edge
        
    b) Every element in CSS can be represented using Box Model. It helps developer to develop and manipulate the elements.
    c) E.g.,
        h1 {
            border : 2px solid blue;
            margin : 5px;
            padding : 20px;     <!-- use padding-top : 20px for top padding only --> 
            content : 50px;
        }
