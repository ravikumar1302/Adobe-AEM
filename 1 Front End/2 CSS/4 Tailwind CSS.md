# Tailwind CSS

1. Tailwind is a `utility-first CSS framework`.
2. It does not come with components; instead, you build your UI by composing utility classes.

3. Key Features:

    - Utility classes for margins, padding, colors, flexbox, grids, etc.
    - Fully customizable via a config file
    - Encourages design systems and component extraction
    - Great integration with frameworks like React, Vue, Laravel, etc.

4. Example (Button in Tailwind):
   `<button class="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded"> Click Me  </button> `

5. Pros:

    - Highly customizable
    - No need to write custom CSS for many layouts/styles
    - Encourages reusable components in JS frameworks

6. Cons:
    - Steeper learning curve at first
    - Classes can become long/cluttered in HTML
    - No built-in components (you build or get them separately)
