BASIC JavaScript THEORY :
JavaScript was first proposed by =

Main Topics : Clousers, Prototype, Event Loop, Async Await,

1. Everything in JS happens inside an Execution Context. It is like a big box that contains 2 things :
    a) Memory or Variable environment (Stores variable and functions as a key : value pair)
    b) Code or Thread of execution (means the coding part)

2. Memory portion of Execution Context is creates as soon as you start writing variables and functions. While the code portion while you run the code
    E.g., 
        var n=2;
        function sqaure(num)    {
            var ans = num*num;
            return ans;
        }
        var square2 = square(n);
        var square4 = square(4);

    The memoroy portion stores like this :
        a) for variable like n, square2, variable name with special value : undefined is stored : (n : undefined)
        b) for functions the whole code is stored :(square : and the whole code)
    When the 2nd phase, Execution phase starts,
        a) For variable :the undefined value gets replaced by the value given by user. In the above code the n : undefined will become n : 2, in the execustion phase
        b) For function :

 
3. JS is a Synchronous, Single threaded language
    Synchronous : executes in a specific order, means firstly the first line and then the second and so on
    Single threaded : executes one command at a time like interpreter
