# Bootstrap

1. Bootstrap is a `component-based CSS Framework` developed by Twitter. It comes with pre-designed UI components and layout utilities.
2. Key Features:

    - Pre-built components (buttons, navbars, modals, carousels, etc.)
    - Grid system (12-column layout using Flexbox)
    - Responsive design out of the box
    - JavaScript plugins (like modals, dropdowns, tooltips)

3. Example (Button in Bootstrap):
   `<button class="btn btn-primary">Click Me</button>`

4. Pros:

    - Quick prototyping with ready-to-use components
    - Good for building dashboards, admin panels, and MVPs
    - Large community and lots of documentation

5. Cons:
    - Can look “too Bootstrap-y” if not customized
    - More difficult to create custom designs without overriding styles
