BASIC Points : 

1. CSS selectors are generally case-insensitive. this includes class and ID selectors. So, CSS properties, values, pseudo class names, pseudo element names, element names are case INsensitive. 
But HTML class names are case-sensitive. And CSS class, id , urls, font-families are case sensitive. This has not changed in HTML5.
Note : in html quirks mode the css is case insensitive even for ID and class (if you remove doctype declaration)
