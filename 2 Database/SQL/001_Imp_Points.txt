BASIC Points : 

1. SQl is not case-sensitive language. But it is prefered to write keyword in UPPER-CASE and objects we are refreng to like table are taken in LOWER-CASE
    Also, Variable names are also not case-sensetive. Name == name == NAME in SQL

2. Every command in SQL ends with semi-colan(;)
3.  Execute (All or Selection) -> Ctrl + Shift + Enter.
    Execute Current Statement -> Ctrl + Enter.

4. Single ('')  and double (" ") both quotes are allowed in SQL for string, but single quote is prefered
5.
