1. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the standard language used to style HTML content.

2. CSS3 is just the latest evolution of CSS â€” it added new features like:
    - Media queries
    - Flexbox
    - Grid
    - Transitions, animations
    - New selectors and pseudo-classes

ðŸ’¡ Think of CSS3 as a version of CSS, not a separate language.
