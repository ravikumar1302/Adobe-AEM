0. Main Cloud providers : Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Service (AWS), Google Cloud
1. Think Cloud as Electricity, it is a service, provided by someone else, and we pay for what we use
2. Cloud Service models : 
    a) Iaas : Infrastructure as a Service - Only hardware, resources (server and network) is provided, rest is done by user. E.g., AWS Elasstic Compute Cloud (EC2). In IaaS, the users receive computing resources like software or hardware tools virtually over the internet. DigitalOcean, Linode, Rackspace are the example of an IaaS service.
    b) Paas : Platfrom as a Service - Provides a platform on which software can be developed and deployed. Eg., AWS Elastic Beanstalk. So, we don't pay for infrastructure, we code on the platform provided by them. In PaaS, the users receive hardware or software tools from the users on the internet. AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Windows Azure, Heroku are example of a PaaS service
    c) Saas : Software as a Service - Cloud providers host and manage the software application on na subscription basis.  Everything is made on server, user login and user, like Gmail, Facebook, AWS etc. So, the end product is provided directly by vendor
    d) etc

3. Cloud deployment models : 
    a) Public
    b) Private
    c) Hybrid
    d) Community

4. Benefits of cloud Computing :
    - Speed
    - Cost
    - Scalabillty
    - Accessibilty
    - Better Security

5. Lifecycle of Cloud computing solution :
    a) Define purpose
    b) Define hardware like EC2, Lambda, Elastic container service
    c) Define storage like S3, EFS, Glacier
    d) Define network like VPC, Route 53, Direct Connect
    e) Define Security like IAM, KMS, Cognito
    f) Define Management processes and tools like CloudWatch, Auto scaling, CloudFormation
    g) Testing the process like CodeStar, CodeBuild, CodePipeline
    h) Analytics : Athena, EMR, CloudSearch

6. Azure CDN (Content Delivery Network) : It is delivery network that fastly transfer viral data. 
    It delivers content while protecting apps, APIs, and websites from cyberthreats, and works seamlessly with Azure services and modern content delivery network (CDN) technology. 
    Azure Content Delivery Network is a globally distributed network of servers that can efficiently deliver web content to consumers.
