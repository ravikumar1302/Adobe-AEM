# Understanding an AEM Project â€“ Quick Guide

When you download an AEM project, youâ€™ll typically see folders like `ui.core`, `ui.apps` and `ui.frontend` etc. Details of some of the folders are :

## 1. Project Structure Overview

| Folder             | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `core` / `ui.core` | Java code â€“ Sling Models, Servlets, OSGi Services                                                                                                                                              |
| `ui.apps`          | AEM Components, templates, dialogs and JS/CSS clientlibs                                                                                                                                       |
| `ui.content`       | Site structure and pages (`/content`). It also contains sample content using the components from the ui.apps                                                                                   |
| `ui.frontend`      | JS/CSS using Webpack; outputs to clientlibs. contains React components.                                                                                                                        |
| `it.tests`         | Integration test cases. Java bundle containing JUnit tests that are executed server-side. This bundle is not to be deployed onto production. This module is usually run during CI builds only. |
| `dispatcher`       | Dispatcher config (if present)                                                                                                                                                                 |

## 2. What Is This Project For?

-   Check `README.md` if present.
-   Look inside `/content/[your-site]` in CRXDE to see if itâ€™s a full site or a feature.
-   Check `/apps/[your-project]/components` to view reusable UI pieces. Also check for base components under /apps/core or /apps/[your-project]/core/components if following Adobe's Core Components model.

---

## 3. Key Code Areas

-   **Sling Models** (`ui.core`): Backend Java classes with `@Model`, pulling data from JCR.
-   **Components** (`ui.apps`): HTML (HTL), JS, dialogs, and CSS; core of UI rendering.
-   **Clientlibs**: JS/CSS folders grouped under `clientlibs-site` or per component. Grouped under /apps/[project]/clientlibs or inside each componentâ€™s folder.
-   **Frontend** (`ui.frontend`): Optional Webpack-based build for assets.

## 4. Running the Project Locally

1. **Build and deploy**  
   Run from project root:

    ```
    mvn clean install -PautoInstallSinglePackage
    ```

2. **Access locally**  
   AEM Author: `http://localhost:4502`  
   Default login: `admin / admin`

3. **Explore in CRXDE**  
   Visit: `http://localhost:4502/crx/de`  
   Browse `/apps`, `/content`, and components.

4. **Sites Console**  
   Preview your site at: `/sites.html/content/[your-project]`

## 5. Tools to Know

-   **CRXDE Lite** â€“ View/edit repository content
-   **AEM Plugin (IntelliJ/VS Code)** â€“ Easier development sync
-   **Logs** â€“ Watch `error.log` in `crx-quickstart/logs` for debugging

---

## 6. What to Learn First (If You're New)

-   **Sling Models** â€“ Bridge between Java and content
-   **HTL (Sightly)** â€“ Adobe's templating language for UI
-   **Dialogs** â€“ Author-side form fields for components
-   **Component Lifecycle** â€“ Understand how components are authored, rendered, and cached
