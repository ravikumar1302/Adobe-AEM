SCSS (Sassy CSS)

SCSS is a syntax of SASS, which is a CSS preprocessor — it adds programming-like features to CSS:

- Variables
        $primary-color: #3498db;
        body { color: $primary-color; }

- Nesting

        .nav {
        ul {
            li {
            a {
                color: red;
            }
            }
        }
        }

- Mixins, functions, loops, and more
- But remember: SCSS compiles down to regular CSS, which browsers understand.

| Technology | Type             | Purpose                                     |
| ---------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- |

| CSS3       | Version of CSS   | Adds modern layout and effects              |
| SCSS       | CSS preprocessor | Adds logic, nesting, and reusability to CSS |


- If you're working on larger or modular front-end projects, SCSS is very useful. But to work in SCSS, you need a build tool (like Webpack, Gulp, or AEM’s clientlibs processor) to compile it to CSS.
